# Kula Warp
Kula Warp is a tribute to [Kula World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kula_World), developed by Game Design Sweden AB in 1998. The game is a 3D puzzle platformer that challenges your spatial sense. 

The goal of the game is to collect keys (will turn into energy as soon as I have the assets for that) to activate the warp to the next level. Additional pickups provide points which at the same time provide lives. The arcade like game punishes you for falling short on time or off the level by inflicting a penalty to your total points based on the points accumulated at the time of death.

In order to get to these keys there are multiple ways to change the direction of gravity to allow you to reach even far away points in the level. The means of movement in the game were slightly modified compared to the original Kula World. Rather than jumping, the player can warp forwards or upwards to teleport the sphere through space. The sphere will manifest at the target location and reattach to any block in the vicinity. This provides an intriguing new way to change gravity and circumvent obstacles. 
## About the Project 
The project was started end of June/beginning of July 2019 to build a portfolio to demonstrate technical skills and familiarity with some of the tools needed to develop games. All code, content and assets were (mostly) developed by one person. A list of resources for some of the images and textures is given below. 

Kula World was chosen as convenient target due to its comparatively small scope. The limited level geometry makes it less reliant on 3D and CG assets than other games and, thus, makes it possible for one person to create a playable demo in a relatively short time. 

The project is ongoing and very far from being finished. However, it demonstrates design concepts and skills used to develop the game thus far. 
## Getting Started
The game was developed with [Unity 2019.1.7f1 Personal](https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download/archive). All files necessary to build the game yourself should be included in the repository. 	

If you would like to test a pre-built version of the game, here are some binaries compiled on August, 13th 2019 from the master branch:
* Windows
* Mac OS 
* Linux
